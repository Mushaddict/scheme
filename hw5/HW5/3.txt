3. Distinguish the variable binding semantics of Language 位D from Racket. Give an example of a program that behaves differently in 位D and in Racket. 
Answer:
位D is dynamically scoped,  Racket is lexically scoped.
Exmaple:
(let (x 5)
(let (f (lambda (y) (+ x y))
(let (x 0) 
(f 6)
)))
In Racket, it is evaluated to 11.
In 位D, it is evaluated to 6.
